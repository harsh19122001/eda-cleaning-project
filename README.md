# EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis (Student Project)

This repository contains my EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) practice project where I worked with a raw, unclean dataset and transformed it into a clean, structured format suitable for analytics and machine learning.

## 📌 What This Project Covers

- Importing and exploring data (head, tail, info, shape, columns)
- Detecting missing values using isnull() and isna()
- Cleaning text columns using regex (str.replace)
- Extracting numeric values from text fields using str.extract
- Handling missing values with mean and mode imputation
- Converting data into proper numeric formats
- Saving the cleaned dataset to a CSV file
- Creating visualizations:
  - Salary distribution (histogram + distplot)
  - Boxenplot (Experience vs Salary)
  - Linear relationship plots using lmplot
- Creating dummy variables using pd.get_dummies() for ML readiness

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Missing Value Handling  
- Regex Techniques  
- Data Visualization  
- Understanding Data Distributions  
- Feature Preparation for ML  
- One-Hot Encoding  

## 🛠 Tools Used
